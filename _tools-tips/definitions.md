#### Network Account
Network user accounts are user accounts that are defined on the network, rather than on a local machine. It is assumed that these network accounts are the primary type used, and that local (machine) accounts are accessed primarily through network level accounts and credentials.

#### Privileged Network Account
A network account with elevated privileges, typically allocated to administrators.

#### Non-User Account
An account that is not intended to be controlled directly by a person (or group). The account is either (a) intended to be used by the system or an application, which presents credentials and performs functions under the management of the person (or group) that owns the account, or (b) created to establish a service (like a group mailbox), and no one is expected to log into the account.

#### Shared Account
An account that is utilized by a group rather than an individual person. Shared accounts are not associated with a particular person.
