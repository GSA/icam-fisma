<p class="usa-alert-text"><H4>Why are Metrics 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 important?</H4>It is important to authenticate credentials when a user accesses a new network. Additionally, users must use a PIV credential to log onto the networks to mitigate attacks such as <i>Pass the Hash.</i> </p>

### [Users with Privileged Local System Accounts and Users Required to Use PIV/NIST Approved Credentials](collection-27-28)

    <p>• Understanding this user population helps to validate that they have the appropriate access across information systems.</p>
    <p>• Issuing the appropriate credentials to user populations is meaningless unless agencies are requiring the use of these credentials.</p>
