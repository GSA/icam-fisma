**_Where Do I Start?_**

1. Search the user repository (Active Directory) for accounts used for network logon.
> •  See [Tools & Tips for Active Directory](../tools-tips/searchAD) or [Tools & Tips for Active Directory-PIV](../tools-tips/searchAD-PIV) for examples of techniques to search Active Directory.
2.	Count the accounts that are assigned to/used by individual people and record number for Metric 2.6.   
3. Now, count the number of accounts that are shared by 2 or more people and record number for Metric 2.6.1.
> •  See [Additional Information](../priv-mgmt/additional-info) for examples of shared accounts.
4. Of the accounts identified in Step 2, identify the number of users of the accounts. Take care to eliminate duplicates from the count if two accounts are researched and identified to be assigned to the same person. Record this number for Metric 2.5. <br>
