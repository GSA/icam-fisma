### Where Do I Start?

The target frequency of user privilege reviews may be dictated by your enterprise-level ICAM policy.

1. 	If you *don't* have a target frequency specified by a enterprise-level policy, please respond with *N/A*.
2. If you *do* have a target frequency specified, please review your enterprise-level ICAM policy and provide that frequency for Metric 2.5.5.

<p>
  A <i>(User) Privilege</i> is a right granted to an individual, a program, or a process [Source: CNSSI-4009]. Privileges can pertain to both a <i>person</i> user and a <i>system</i> user, and allow that user to access information in accordance with their duties and a valid <i>“need to know.”</i> Different agencies have different needs based on their size, turnover, and other determining factors.
