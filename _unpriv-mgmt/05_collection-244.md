### Unprivileged Network Users Covered by a Centralized Dynamic Access Management Solution ![calc logo](../img/calc.png){:style="width:40px;float:right;"}
Your agency may have implemented a centralized dynamic access management solution that controls and monitors access for its users. This type of solution is commonly known as attribute-based access control (ABAC).

#### Where do I Start?

1.	If your agency *is not* leveraging an ABAC like model, please respond with N/A.
2.	If your agency *does* leverage an ABAC like model, determine the data sources providing dynamic information used to make access decisions in your model.
3.	Determine what attributes are associated with these sources and associated with the accounts in your directory(ies).
4.	Count the number of users (starting with the population identified in [Metric 2.4.1](../unpriv-mgmt/collection-241)) who are authorized to access resources using this model and report for <b>Metric 2.4.4</b>.

A centralized dynamic access management solution model is similar to an Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) model. These types of models provide an attribute-based approach to accommodate a wide breadth of access control policies and help simplify access control management.</p>

    •	 Please refer to <a href="https://arch.idmanagement.gov/usecases/36_access_authorize_dynamic/">Use Case 18: Authorize Access - Dynamic</a> from the FICAM Architecture to understand the process behind a centralized dynamic access management solution.
 <br><br>
  •	 Per NIST SP 800-162, ABAC is a logical access control model that controls access to objects by evaluating rules against the attributes of the entities actions, and based on the environment relevant to a request. All ABAC solutions contain capabilities to evaluate attributes and environment conditions.  To learn more about ABAC, please refer to<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-162.pdf"> NIST SP 800-162 - Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations.</a>
<br><br>
  •	 In December 2011, the <a href="https://www.idmanagement.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/1171/uploads/FICAM_Roadmap_and_Implem_Guid.pdf"> FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Plan v2.0</a> included ABAC as a recommended access control model for promoting information sharing between diverse and disparate organizations. ABAC provides an attribute-based approach to accommodate a wide breadth of access control policies and helps simplify access control management.
