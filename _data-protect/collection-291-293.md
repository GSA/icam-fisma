### Where Do I Start?
1. Look at the list of FIPS-199 systems from Metric 1.1.
2. Work with the System Owner or Information System Security Officer (ISSO) for each system.
3. Count the number of high impact systems that require all users to authenticate using a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST approved credential. Different system types may have different configurations or techniques for enforcing PIV authentication.
>•	Be sure to include all sub-systems.
4. Record this number for Metric 2.9.1.
5.	Follow steps 1 and 2 above.
6.	Count the number of moderate impact systems that require all users to authenticate using a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST approved credential. Different system types may have different configurations or techniques for enforcing PIV authentication.
>•	Be sure to include all sub-systems.
7.	Record this number for Metric 2.9.2.
8.	Follow steps 1 and 2 above.
9.	Count the number of low impact systems that require all users to authenticate using a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST approved credential. Different system types may have different configurations or techniques for enforcing PIV authentication.
>•	Be sure to include all sub-systems.
10.	Record this number for Metric 2.9.3.

    For each FIPS 199 impact level, what is the number of operational unclassified information systems by organization (i.e. Bureau or Sub-Department Operating Element) categorized at that level? (Organizations with fewer than 5,000 users may report as one unit. (NIST SP 800-60, NIST 800-53r4 RA-2)
