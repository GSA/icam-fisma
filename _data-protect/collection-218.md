1. Look at the list of FIPS-199 systems from Metric 1.1.
2. Work with the ISSO for each system.
3. Count the systems that require all users to authenticate using PIV (or other NIST LOA 4 Credentials).
> • Different system types may have different configurations or techniques for enforcing PIV authentication.\\
> • Be sure to include all sub-systems.\
4. Record this number for Metric 2.18.
