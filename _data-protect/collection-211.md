### Where Do I Start?
<p>
1. Look at the list of FIPS-199 systems from Metric 1.1.</p>
<p>
2. Work with the System Owner or Information System Security Officer (ISSO) for each system.</p>
<p>
3. Count the systems that require <b>all users</b> to authenticate using a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST approved credential..</p>
<ul>
<li>Different system types may have different configurations or techniques for enforcing PIV authentication.</li>
<li>Be sure to include all sub-systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>
4. Record this number for Metric 2.11. </p>

    For each FIPS 199 impact level, what is the number of operational unclassified information systems by organization (i.e. Bureau or Sub-Department Operating Element) categorized at that level? (Organizations with fewer than 5,000 users may report as one unit.)
