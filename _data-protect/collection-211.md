#### Where Do I Start? <br>
<p>
1. Look at the list of FIPS-199 systems from Metric 1.1.</p>
<p>
2. Work with the ISSO for each system.</p>
<p>
3. Count the systems that require all users to authenticate using PIV Credentials.</p>

> • Different system types may have different configurations or techniques for enforcing PIV authentication.<br>

> • Be sure to include all sub-systems.
<p>
4. Record this number for Metric 2.11.

    <p class="usa-alert-text"><H4>Why is Metric 2.11 important?</H4>
    Issuing the appropriate credentials to user populations is meaningless unless agencies require the use of these credentials. Improper authentication of credentials may put an agency at risk.</p>

    <p class="usa-alert-text"><H4>What information was in Metric 1.1?</H4>
    For each FIPS 199 impact level, what is the number of operational unclassified information systems by organization (i.e. Bureau or Sub-Department Operating Element) categorized at that level? (Organizations with fewer than 5,000 users may report as one unit.).</p>
