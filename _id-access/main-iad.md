### [Identity and Access Management](collection-23-231)

| 2.3. | Date of issuance of an [enterprise-level](../tools-tips/fisma-def) Identity, Credential, and Access Management policy. ([OMB Circular A-130,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a130_a130trans4) [Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12),](https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-presidential-directive-12) [NIST SP 800-53r4 AC-6(7)](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf))
| 2.3.1. |  [Enterprise-level](../tools-tips/fisma-def) Identity, Credential, and Access Management policy contains processes for the review of user privileges, provisioning privileges upon entry, revoking privileges upon exit, and modifying privileges based on changes in duties. (e.g. role based access control).

<p>
ICAM may be operated or managed separately across numerous offices, programs, and systems within your agency. An enterprise-level policy provides baseline standards and procedures for your agency to establish and examine the implementation of its security technology and processes for accuracy and consistency. While your agency’s enterprise-level policy should address capabilities across identity, credential, and access management, this new metric focuses on making sure the policy enumerates specific procedures related to management of access privileges.</p>
<p>
Ensuring that the access management portion of your ICAM policy articulates procedures around access provisioning and reviews enables your organization to:</p>
<p>
  •  Identify potential modifications to the access policies governing authorization to protected IT resources;</p>
<p>
  •  Realize the need to update the digital access management policies, based on software system changes <i>(e.g., The addition of new roles or access rights within a system, the removal of permissions, fundamental changes to the features of a system);</i></p>
<p>
  •  Validate that access management systems are configured as expected; and </p>
<p>
  •  Identify deficiencies due to human error, gaps in protection, segregation of duties issues, or areas where users have more access permissions than necessary for a feature.</p>
