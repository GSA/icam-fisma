Your agency may have a documented and published policy regarding information security, information assurance, cybersecurity, or similar function. This enterprise-level policy may articulate standards or procedures for technology and business processes regarding ICAM. Designated components or bureaus within your agency may also document and maintain organization-specific policies. Please refer to the policy(ies) that governs your organization’s information security practices.
### Where Do I Start?

1. If you <i>don’t</i> have a policy that enumerates enterprise-level ICAM standards and procedures, please respond with <i>N/A</i> for Metric 2.3 and <i>N/A</i> for Metric 2.3.1.
2. If you <i>do</i> have an enterprise-level ICAM policy, record the <i>most recent date of issuance</i> for Metric 2.3.
3. If your ICAM policy contains processes for the <i>review</i> of user privileges, <i>provisioning</i> privileges upon entry, <i>revoking</i> privileges upon exit, and <i>modifying</i> privileges based on changes in duties, please provide these <b>processes and or policy references</b> for Metric 2.3.1.

  <H4>Access Management Policy Procedures</H4>
<p>
Metric 2.3.1. asks for procedures specific to access provisioning, de-provisioning, and recertification. Most of these procedures are consistent with security controls found in NIST SP 800-53 rev 4 in the <i>Access Control</i> family. A more holistic access management policy may contain a broader set of procedures and targets, including: </p>
<p>
  •  Frequency of access recertification for users with access to your network and systems, including privileged users;</p>
<p>
  •  How privileges, or access permissions, are created, maintained, and revoked for all users, including privileged users;</p>
<p>
  •  Who in the organization is enabled to create, recertify, and revoke privileges; </p>
<p>
  •  How the organization determines the required authentication level and technology for networks and systems, including procedures for PIV-enablement; and</p>
<p>
  •  Who in the organization is enabled to create and change access management procedures and targets.</p>
