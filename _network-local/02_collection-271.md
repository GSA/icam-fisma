### Number of High Value Asset (HVA) Systems![calc logo](../img/calc.png){:style="width:40px;float:right;"}
#### Where Do I Start?

1.	Using the information collected in [Metric 2.7](../network-local/collection-27), identify the number of HVA systems that do not enforce users to authenticate through the machine-based or user-based enforcement of a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST 800-63 r3 IAL3/AAL3 credential.  

2.	For each of these systems, work with the System Owner and ISSO to determine if the system has been granted a security waiver due to an approved audit or similar agency risk acceptance procedure. These forms may exist as artifacts within the Authority to Operate package associated with the systemâ€™s FISMA ID. Record this number for <b>Metric 2.7.1</b>.
