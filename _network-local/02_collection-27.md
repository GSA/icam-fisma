### Number of High Value Asset (HVA) Systems![calc logo](../img/calc.png){:style="width:40px;float:right;"}
#### Where Do I Start?

1. Please refer to your agencyâ€™s High Value Asset (HVA) list to determine the total number of HVA systems at your agency and which systems those are.

2. Work with the System Owner or Information System Security Officer (ISSO) for each HVA system identified in step 1 to determine the number of HVA systems that require all users to authenticate through the machine-based or user based enforcement of a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST 800-63 r3 IAL3/AAL3 credential. This information may be available in the System Security Plan for each HVA, and potentially in control IA-2(12). Record this number for <b>Metric 2.7</b>.
