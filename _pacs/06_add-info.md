<p>
1. Create an excel based inventory of all readers for a “given area”.</p>
> • Take note of the make, model, hardware revision, and firmware revision.
>
• Take note of whether the above matches what is listed on the APL.
<p>
2. Determine/Confirm which validation system is configured to support the reader.</p>
> • Log into pivCLASS PACS Services Server
>
• Open pivCLASS PACS Service Administration Application, log in if necessary
>
• Go to Tools > Configure PACS Service
>
• Click the Reader Services Tab
>
• In the left panel, expand the “Panels” tree
>
• For each PAM panel configured: (1) Match the readers therein to the readers inventoried above, and (2) note which Assurance profile the reader is configured.
>
• Write this information on the Inventory Report.
