<p>
<b>How do I look through my PACS software in an HID Validation Solution Environment?</b></p>
<p>
1. Create an excel based inventory of all readers for a “given area”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take note of the make, model, hardware revision, and firmware revision.</li>
<li>Take note of whether the above matches what is listed on the APL.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Determine/Confirm which validation system is configured to support the reader.</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into pivCLASS PACS Services Server</li>
<li>Open pivCLASS PACS Service Administration Application, log in if necessary.</li>
<li>Go to Tools > Configure PACS Service.</li>
<li>Click the Reader Services Tab</li>
<li>In the left panel, expand the “Panels” tree</li>
<li>For each PAM panel configured: (1) Match the readers therein to the readers inventoried above, and (2) note which Assurance profile the reader is configured.</li>
<li>Write this information on the Inventory Report.</li>
</ul>
<i>If you use a different vendor’s validation system, and are not sure how to collect these metrics, please email</i> [icam@gsa.gov](mailto:icam@gsa.gov) <i>for assistance. </i>
