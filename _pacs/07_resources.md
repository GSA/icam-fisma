How do I look through my PACS software in an HID Validation Solution Environment?

1. Create an excel based inventory of all readers for a “given area”.
> • Take note of the make, model, hardware revision, and firmware revision\\
> • Take note of whether the above matches what is listed on the APL\
2. Determine/Confirm which validation system is configured to support the reader
> • Log into pivCLASS PACS Services Server\\
> • Open pivCLASS PACS Service Administration Application, log in if necessary\\
> • Go to Tools > Configure PACS Service\\
> • Click the Reader Services Tab\\
> • In the left panel, expand the “Panels” tree\\
> • For each PAM panel configured: (1) Match the readers therein to the readers inventoried above, and (2) note which Assurance profile the reader is configured.\\
> • Write this information on the Inventory Report.
