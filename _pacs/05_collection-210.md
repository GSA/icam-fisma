### PACS Procurement Compliance & PIV Enforcement ![calc logo](../img/calc.png){:style="width:40px;float:right;"}
### Where Do I Start?
<p>
1. Work with your agency’s Physical Security personnel to identify all perimeter and sensitive area access readers across all locations in your agency.</p>
<p>
2. Identify each instance of a PACS validation system in use across the agency.</p>
<p> 3. Validate that the product's (readers and validation software) comply with NIST FIPS 201. Compliant products are listed on the <a href="https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list/">GSA Approved Products List (APL).</a> Hardware and software versioning and other specific information can be found inside the Approved Letters on the APL. Only the exact versions of hardware and software listed are compliant. </p>

>•	See [PACS Resources](section-resources)  for sample steps to check for compliance.

>•	Take note of whether the above matches what is listed on the APL.

<p>
4. Determine which validation system is configured for each compliant reader. Count the number of readers that comply, divide by the total number of readers the agency has across all locations and multiply by 100.</p>
<p>
5. Divide Step 4 by the total number from Step 1, and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage for this metric. Record this number for Metric 2.10.</p>
