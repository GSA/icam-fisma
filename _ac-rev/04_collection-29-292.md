#### Where Do I Start? <br>
<p>
1. Consult your CIO Policy Office or similar organization for the presence of the appropriate Identity, Credential and Access Management (ICAM) Policy and request the date it was signed into force.  </p>
<p>
2. If there is a policy per Metric 2.9, consult the text for the existence of a section pertaining to timelines for the review of user privileges.</p>
<p>
3. If there is not a policy per Metric 2.9, consult the text for the existence of a section pertaining to procedures for provisioning privileges upon entry, revoking privileges upon exit and modifying privileges based on the change of duties.</p>

<p class="usa-alert-text"><H4>Why is Metric 2.9 important?</H4></p>
<i>Metric 2.9 will enable agencies to:</i><br>
•  Align with government-wide requirements;
<br>
•  Identify how technological advancements and government-wide changes to ICAM-related policy and priorities may influence the need to re-evaluate the existing agency ICAM program governance, procurement, and implementations.
<br>
•  The process of recertification is crucial to successful access management because a user needs the correct access to the right resources to fulfill his or her job function.
<br>
•  Core information security principles of segregation of duties, least privilege, and need-to-know depend on account recertification.
