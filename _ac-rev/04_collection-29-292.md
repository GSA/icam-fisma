## Metric 2.9
---
Your agency may have a documented and published policy regarding information security, information assurance, cybersecurity, or similar function. This enterprise-level policy may articulate standards or procedures for technology and business processes regarding ICAM. Designated components or bureaus within your agency may also document and maintain organization-specific policies. Please refer to the policy(ies) that governs your organization’s information security practices.
### Where Do I Start?
<p>
1. If you <i>don’t</i> have a policy that enumerates enterprise-level ICAM standards and procedures, please respond with <i>N/A</i>.</p>
<p>
2.	If you <i>do</i> have an enterprise-level ICAM policy, record the <i>most recent date of issuance</i> for Metric 2.9.</p>

<p>
Metrics 2.9.1 and 2.9.2 ask for procedures specific to access provisioning, de-provisioning, and recertification. Most of these procedures are consistent with security controls found in NIST SP 800-53 rev 4 in the <i>Access Control</i> family. A more holistic access management policy may contain a broader set of procedures and targets, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency of access recertification for users with access to your network and systems, including privileged users;</li>
<li>How privileges, or access permissions, are created, maintained, and revoked for all users, including privileged users;</li>
<li>Who in the organization is enabled to create, recertify, and revoke privileges; </li>
<li>How the organization determines the required authentication level and technology for networks and systems, including procedures for PIV-enablement; and</li>
<li>Who in the organization is enabled to create and change access management procedures and targets.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

## Metric 2.9.1
---
<p>
Reviewing user privileges is important to managing risk in an organization because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is essential to identifying and neutralizing user access vulnerabilities or violations; and</li>
<li>It enables the core information security principles of segregation of duties, least privilege, and need-to-know.</li></ul>
### Where Do I Start?
<p>
1. If you <i>don’t</i> have a policy that enumerates enterprise-level ICAM standards and procedures, or your existing ICAM policies <i>don’t</i> provide targets or frequency for the review of user privileges for network and system access, please respond with <i>N/A</i>.</p>
<p>
2. If your ICAM policy dictates the timelines and frequency of user privilege reviews, please provide these target(s) for Metric 2.9.1. </p>

A <i>(User) Privilege</i> is a right granted to an individual, a program, or a process [Source: CNSSI-4009]. Privileges can pertain to both a <i>person</i> user and a <i>system</i> user, and allow that user to access information in accordance with their duties and a valid <i>“need to know.”</i> Different agencies have different needs based on their size, turnover, and other determining factors.

### Where Do I Start?
<p>
1.	If you <i>don’t</i> have a policy that enumerates enterprise-level ICAM standards and procedures, or your existing ICAM policies <i>don’t</i> provide procedures for provisioning privileges upon entry, revoking privileges upon exit, and modifying privileges based on changes in duties, please respond with <i>N/A</i>.</p>
<p>
2.	If your ICAM policy dictates procedures for provisioning privileges upon entry, revoking privileges upon exit, and modifying privileges based on changes in duties, please provide these reference procedures for Metric 2.9.1.</p>
