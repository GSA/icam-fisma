**_Where Do I Start?_**

1. Consult your CIO Policy Office or similar organization for the presence of the appropriate Identity, Credential and Access Management (ICAM) Policy and request the date it was signed into force.  

2. If there is a policy per Metric 2.9, consult the text for the existence of a section pertaining to timelines for the review of user privileges.

3. If there is not a policy per Metric 2.9, consult the text for the existence of a section pertaining to procedures for provisioning privileges upon entry, revoking privileges upon exit and modifying privileges based on the change of duties.
