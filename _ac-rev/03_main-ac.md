| 2.9.1 | Enterprise-level ICAM policy contains timelines for the review of user privileges.

<p>
ICAM cuts across numerous offices, programs, and systems within an agency‘s enterprise, which are typically directed and managed separately. An enterprise-level policy provides baseline standards and procedures for your organization to establish and examine the implementation of its security technology and processes for accuracy and consistency. While an agency’s enterprise-level policy should address capabilities across identity, credential, and access management, this new metric focuses on making sure the policy enumerates specific procedures related to management of access privileges.</p>
<p>
Ensuring that the access management portion of your ICAM policy articulates procedures around access provisioning and reviews enables your organization to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify potential modifications to the access policies governing authorization to protected IT resources;</li>
<li>Realize the need to update the digital access management policies, based on software system changes <i>(e.g., The addition of new roles or access rights within a system, the removal of permissions, fundamental changes to the features of a system);</i></li>
<li>Validate that access management systems are configured as expected; and </li>
<li>Identify deficiencies due to human error, gaps in protection, segregation of duties issues, or areas where users have more access permissions than necessary for a feature.</li>
</ul>
