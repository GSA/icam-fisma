There are <b>15</b> ICAM-related metrics in the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/FY%202017%20CIO%20FISMA%20Metrics-%20508%20Compliant.pdf"> FY18 CIO FISMA Metrics</a> [PLACEHOLDER], including several new metrics that have not been collected in previous years. FY18 ICAM-related metrics can be found under Section 2 (Protect) of the guidance and below.

<center><h3><u>FY18 ICAM-related Metrics</u></h3></center>

2.4 | <a href="unpriv-mgmt/collection-26-24">Number of users with unprivileged network accounts (Exclude privileged network accounts and non-user accounts).</a>
2.4.1 | <a href="unpriv-mgmt/collection-241-242">Number of users (from 2.4) technologically required to log onto the network with a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST approved credential.</a>
2.4.2 | <a href="unpriv-mgmt/collection-241-242">Number of users (from 2.4) allowed to use username and password as their primary method for network authentication.</a>

2.8 | <a href="priv-mgmt/collection-27-28">Number of users (from 2.7) technologically required to log onto the system with a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST approved credential.</a>
2.9 | <a href="ac-rev/collection-29-292">Date of issuance for enterprise-level Identity and Access Management (ICAM) policy.</a>
2.9.1 | <a href="ac-rev/collection-29-292">Enterprise-level ICAM policy contains timelines for the review of user privileges.</a>
2.9.2 | <a href="ac-rev/collection-29-292">Enterprise-level ICAM policy contains procedures for provisioning privileges upon entry, revoking privileges upon exit, and modifying privileges based on changes in duties (e.g. role based access control).</a>
2.10 | <a href="pacs/collection-210">Percent (%) of agency’s operational PACS that electronically accept and authenticate internal users’ PIV credentials for routine access in accordance with NIST standards and guidelines (e.g., FIPS 201-2 and NIST SP 800-116).</a>
2.11 | <a href="data-protect/collection-211">Number of high and moderate impact systems from metric 1.1 that require all users (100% privileged and 100% unprivileged) to authenticate using a two-factor PIV credential or other NIST approved credential. (Not required for low impact information systems).</a>

Data collected from these metrics can help your agency prioritize and guide decisions around resource allocation to assure ICAM Program effectiveness. The ultimate goal of these metrics is to enable your agency to ensure the right people have the right access to the right data at the right time. ICAM program advancement is an incremental process and unique to each agency’s mission and business needs.

The GSA FICAM Program has worked with DHS, OMB, and others to develop practical guidance to help your agency collect the data for the ICAM-related FISMA metrics. This guidance is intended to help you logically navigate and interpret the metrics to decrease your reporting time and increase usability and understanding. We hope that senior leadership will have a better “apples-to-apples” comparison across agencies if all agencies have a clearer understanding of what the metrics represent and how to collect and report them.
