# How to Navigate
*The purpose of this document is to provide agencies assistance and guidance with understanding, interpreting, and collecting information for the FY17 ICAM-related Metrics, to reduce the overall reporting burden.*
### Use this document as a How-to-Guide:

The recycle icon next to steps throughout the slides highlights when agencies should save the numbers they collect because they will need that information for other metrics. 

The “why” on the slide is included for informative purposes only and provides insight into why these metrics are important and provide value at the program, agency, and government-wide level.

Examples are provided on several of the metrics to provide the agency with additional context for interpreting the metric. 

Tips are included, when applicable, to give agencies ideas for collection methods.

Assumptions, definitions and references are included (when applicable) to provide the agency with additional context and information.
